# Initial setup of your infrastructure as code environment

## Set up a master keypair

We will first create a master keypair that will be used to access all of the nodes in the cluster including the BMC.

Here we call it ansible_master, if you choose a different name then update the variable public_key in the hosts file.
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "ansible master key" -f $HOME/.ssh/ansible_rsa
# copy the public key to the pub_keys folder in this repo
cp $HOME/.ssh/ansible_rsa.pub pub/ansible_rsa.pub
```

You should create a strong passphrase for this keypair.

## Authorize your keypair for each Turing Pi

Do the following for each of your turing pi boards. The name should be turingpi or turingpi.local for the first board and turingpi-2, turingpi-3 etc for the others.

```bash
# copy over the ansible public key to the turing pi (using password authentication)
scp pub_keys/ansible_rsa.pub root@turingpi:.ssh/authorized_keys
# connect - you will be asked for your passphrase from above
ssh root@turingpi
# change the password to something secure
passwd
# or even better disable password login in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# (but then don't loose your ssh key!)
sed -E -i 's|^#?(PasswordAuthentication)\s.*|\1 no|' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# return to your host
exit
```

## Edit the hosts.yml file

This should reflect your turingpi DNS names, the names you would like to call
the nodes in each of these turingpis and the type of board each of your nodes
has.
